// undefined is a Primitive data type in Javascript.

// Whenever a variable is declared but not initialized or assigned a value, then it is stored as undefined. 
// A function returns undefined if a value was not returned. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.
